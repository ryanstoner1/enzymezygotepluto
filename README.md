# hybrid AD
Here are some Pluto.jl workbooks for a first cut at a temporary workaround for getting fast autodiff with mutation and BLAS operations by combining
``Enzyme`` and ``Zygote`` via ``Enzyme`` pullbacks.

---

To **run** these notebooks in **Binder** use [Pluto on Binder!](https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/)

Yo can copy the *first* workbook link at 
```

```
and so on.
